## Tree data structure
 - root node
 - leaf node
 
 The fundamental rule is that there will be only one path exists between root to the any node in the tree.
 
 ### Binary Tree
   - Hierarchy of data
   - Root node
      - Left Child 
      - Right Child
   - Each child itself a tree.
 
 ##### Binary Search Tree
 
   - Same as binary tree
   - Sorted Hierarchy of Data 
   - There are no structural change this as same as binary tree, impose additional data rule.
       - All the data are sorted
       - `Smallest` value on the `left`
       - `Largest` value on the `right`
