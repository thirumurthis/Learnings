### Starting to learn data structures

In most of the data structures we will be performing below operations

- Inserting data 
- Deleting data 
- Searching or Traversing the data


For example

| Data structure | Note | Insert | Delete | Search |
|-----|----|--------|--------|--------|
| Array | Continuous memory location | We create the array with the data | To delete the data, we need to copy the Array to new Array | Using for loop or while loop we can search for items | 
| Binary Tree | Data greater than the node will be placed in left else on the right side node | Data will inserted to root, after that data less than node will be inserted to left | Deleting a node, falls under different categories | We can use recurssion to search |
