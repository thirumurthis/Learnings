## Resiliency in microservice:

### Rate Limiter pattern:
  - makes service highly available by limiting the number of request made during specific window.
  - Implemented using `resilient4j`

#### Rate Limiter vs Circuit Breaker:
  - Rate Limiter - helps protect the server from over loading by controlling input.
  - Circuit Breaker - helps client functional when the target server failed /unresponsive.
  - Use `@RateLimiter` annotation with configuration in application.yaml

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
   - When request Service B is un-responsive, there is no point to send request from Service A to Service B continuously.
   - The circuit breaker simple skips the call and uses the fall back method/ default values for certain duration.
   - The Circuit breaker pattern retries after some time
   - State: `Based on the failure rate threshold configured`
     - CLOSED - If service is up, request are allowed.
     - OPEN - Service is not available.
     - HALF_OPEN - Once the state becomes OPEN, wait for sometime in OPEN state.
   - Use `@CircuitBreaker` annotation with configuration in application.yaml

### Timeout Pattern
  -  Assume there are multiple services (1,2,3,4), one service (1) might depend on the another service (2) which in turn might depend on 3 and so on. There are possiblities for  some network issue and Service 4 might not respond as expected.
  - This slowness could affect the downstream services â€“ all the way up to Service 1 by blocking the threads in the individual services.
  - It is better to take this service slowness/unavailability issues into consideration while designing your Microservices by setting a timeout for any network call.
  - Use `@TimeLimiter` annotation with configuration in application.yaml
     - Pros: we don''t block the threads indefinitely.
     - Cons: still threads are blocked for short duration

### Bulkhead pattern
